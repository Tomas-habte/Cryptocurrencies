# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we used unsupervised machine learning. We first preprocessed the data for PCA and then reduced the data dimensions using PCA. Next, we clustered cryptocurrencies using K-means and finally visualized the results as shown below.
